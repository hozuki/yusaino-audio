# Yusaino-Audio

A migration of [audio compression solution for Arduino](http://grrrr.org/2011/06/30/arduino-compressed_audio/)
from Python 2 to JavaScript.

This repository contains the audio encoding and decoding (on computer) part. For hardware playback,
please see [Yusaino](later-XD). By re-coding, I am able to understand the whole design.

The main reason of choosing JavaScript is I don't know Python well...

> More details will come when features are finished.
